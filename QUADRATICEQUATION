This code takes the int values of the coefficients, which is then squared after the sqrt of the quadratic equation code is entered. Afterwards, root1 and root2 are added.
The answers for each are:
“The roots of the quadratic equation "2x2 + 6x + 4 = 0" are 7.0 and 4.0”
“The roots of the quadratic equation "2x2 + 6x + 4 = 0" are 3 and 3”
“The roots of the quadratic equation "2x2 + 6x + 4 = 0" are NaN and NaN” ( 0 & 0 )
